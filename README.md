# Mass Recruit from Prison Mod

## Description
Tired of manually recruiting prisoners in your court? This mod allows you to mass recruit and demand conversion from all non-ruler prisoners with a single click. You can even automate this process to run every month via an in-game decision.

## Features
- **Mass Recruit & Convert**: Recruit and convert all landless prisoners at once. They must be willing to accept the terms, just like in the vanilla game. Expect a brief waiting period before receiving their responses.
- **Faith-Based Recruitment**: If a prisoner already shares your faith and is willing to accept recruitment, the mod will handle it seamlessly.
- **Auto-Ransom Update**: Automatically ransom prisoners for money (no hooks) with the new auto-ransom feature. If you prefer using hooks, stick with the vanilla button.

## Important Details
- **Visibility**: The "Mass Action" button appears when you have 5 or more prisoners, similar to other mass actions in the game.
- **Game Rule Control**: Enable or disable the automatic mass recruit feature via a game rule.

## Additional Updates
- **Prowess Threshold**: Customize the prowess threshold for recruitment through an in-game decision.
- **UniUI Compatibility**: Now fully compatible with [UniUI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2768734977&searchtext=uniui)!
- **Mod Compatibility**: Compatible with all other mods. Note that the ransom+recruit buttons in the prison window may disappear, but you can still use the monthly decision to ransom/recruit prisoners. Ensure this mod is prioritized in your playset to overwrite the GUI file changes.
- **TC Compatibility**: Just place this mod before the TC in the load order. You will still be able to use the decisions for the auto recruit/ransom. If the buttons in prison disappear, the TC overwrites the same file and takes priority.

## Localization
- **English**: Translated it myself.
- **German**: (My native language, so hopefully it should be fine).
- **Chinese**: Thanks to [@牛奶大魔王](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2903983628). You need their mod for it to work!
