[h1]Tired of Manually Recruiting Prisoners in Your Court?[/h1]

Is your prison overflowing with potential courtiers, but recruiting each one (and demanding their conversion) manually feels like a chore? Look no further! This mod allows you to mass recruit and demand conversion from all non-ruler prisoners with a single click. You can even automate this process to run every month via an in-game decision.

[h2]Features:[/h2] [list] 
[*][b]Mass interact with prisoners based on your preferences[/b]: Recruit+convert(1 example) all landless prisoners at once. They must be willing to accept the terms, just like in the vanilla game.
[*][b]Auto-Ransom Update[/b]: Automatically ransom prisoners for money (no hooks) with the new auto-ransom feature. If you prefer using hooks, stick with the vanilla button.
[*][b]Prowess Threshold[/b]: Customize the prowess threshold for recruitment through an in-game decision. 
[*][b]Release from prison POPUP removal[/b]: No more annoying popups when you perform the mass actions from the mod on a prisoner.
[*][b]Inclusion of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790872361] Auto Demand Conversion [/url][/b]: Was not fixed for new update yet. If the author wishes me to remove it, i will do so. 
[*][b]Better prison GUI 
[*][b]Open settings on new game optionally (Can be disabled via gamerule)
[*][b]Mass Torture Button
[*][b]Switch Over to Story Cycle on Backend
 [/list]

[h2]Compatibility:[/h2] [list] 
[*][b]UniUI Compatibility[/b]: Now fully compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2768734977&searchtext=uniui]UniUI[/url]!
 [*][b]Mod Compatibility[/b]: Compatible with all other mods. Note that the ransom+recruit buttons in the prison window may disappear, but you can still use the monthly decision to ransom/recruit prisoners. Ensure this mod is prioritized in your playset to overwrite the GUI file changes. 
[*][b]TC Compatibility[/b] Just place this mod before the TC in the load order. You will still be able to use the decisions for the auto recruit/ransom. If the buttons in prison disappear the TC overwrites the same file and take priority.
