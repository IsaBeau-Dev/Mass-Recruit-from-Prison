[h1]Tired of Manually Recruiting Prisoners in Your Court?[/h1]

Is your prison overflowing with potential courtiers, but recruiting each one (and demanding their conversion) manually feels like a chore? Look no further! This mod allows you to mass recruit and demand conversion from all non-ruler prisoners with a single click. You can even automate this process to run every month via an in-game decision.

[h2]Features:[/h2] [list] 
[*][b]Mass Recruit & Convert[/b]: Recruit and convert all landless prisoners at once. They must be willing to accept the terms, just like in the vanilla game. Expect a brief waiting period before receiving their responses. 
[*][b]Faith-Based Recruitment[/b]: If a prisoner already shares your faith and is willing to accept recruitment, the mod will handle it seamlessly. 
[*][b]Auto-Ransom Update[/b]: Automatically ransom prisoners for money (no hooks) with the new auto-ransom feature. If you prefer using hooks, stick with the vanilla button. [/list]

[h2]Important Details:[/h2] [list] 
[*][b]Visibility[/b]: The "Mass Action" button appears when you have 5 or more prisoners, similar to other mass actions in the game. 
[*][b]Game Rule Control[/b]: Enable or disable the automatic mass recruit feature via a game rule. [/list]

[h2]Additional Updates:[/h2] [list] 
[*][b]Prowess Threshold[/b]: Customize the prowess threshold for recruitment through an in-game decision. 
[*][b]UniUI Compatibility[/b]: Now fully compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2768734977&searchtext=uniui]UniUI[/url]!
 [*][b]Mod Compatibility[/b]: Compatible with all other mods. Note that the ransom+recruit buttons in the prison window may disappear, but you can still use the monthly decision to ransom/recruit prisoners. Ensure this mod is prioritized in your playset to overwrite the GUI file changes. 
[*][b]TC Compatibility[/b] Just place this mod before the TC in the load order. You will still be able to use the decisions for the auto recruit/ransom. If the buttons in prison disappear the TC overwrites the same file and take priority.
